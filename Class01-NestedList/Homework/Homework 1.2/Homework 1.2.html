<body>
    <p>Potatoes are typically thought of as a humble and hearty food—the dish you make when you’re in need of a hug or when you’re tempering a hangry mood. But there are thousands of varieties of potatoes and much like the cook who’s looking for them, each are unique. But in the name of simplification, our knobby, tuberous friends can be broken down into three general categories: starchy, waxy, and all-purpose. The texture of the potato you pick is the most important factor when considering how to use it—the one that fries up crispy in the pan is different from the one that boils well for a potato salad. The answer behind these discrepancies? Science! Starchy potatoes bloat when boiled, as water seeps into their cells to create a crumbly consistency. This makes them ideal for baking or frying, where they’ll at once puff up and absorb flavor. In contrast, waxy potatoes repel excess water from entering their cells, so their texture holds up better when stewed, scalloped, or roasted. But of course, it doesn’t end there. Grab your spading fork and read on to learn about each major variety, how to select the best ones, and how to prepare them like a pro.</p>

        <li>Red bliss potatoes live up to their name, imparting a tender texture and delicate flavor. They reside in the waxy category and are suitable for boiling and slicing in salads or casseroles. Red bliss potatoes sit pretty in this roasted and herbed pork loin and effortlessly wear the creamy coating in this potato salad with peas.

<p><b>Russet:</b></p>
<img src="Photos/Russet.jpg"/>
<ul>
    <li>Russets are actually a family of potatoes which share the same russet-colored skin. Of the starchy variety, they make for a lovely base in mashed or baked potato recipes. The best russets will be both large and firm, while their skin will be thick and rough. As with all potatoes, avoid those that are green and ensure you eat those that have sprouted sooner, rather than later.
