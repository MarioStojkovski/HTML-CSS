<p><b>More about air pollution:</b></p>
    <p>Air pollution is the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane, carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution may cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Both human activity and natural processes can generate air pollution.</p>
<p><b>What causes air pollution?</b></p>
    <p>Air pollution stems from a variety of sources, both natural and man-made. To increase public awareness, news reports of the health effects of exposure to air pollution has increased in recent years—as a result, we now have a good understanding of where most air pollution comes from. </p>
    <p>When it comes to outdoor air pollution, some of the primary sources include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Traffic exhaust:
            <ul>
                <li> According to the EPA, some of the main pollutants from traffic exhaust include particulate matter, benzene, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. Plus, some of the compounds in exhaust fumes can react with chemicals in the air to form nitrogen dioxide and ozone, two additional pollutants with known health effects.
                    <ul>
                        <li>EPA or The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is an independent executive agency of the United States federal government tasked with environmental protection matters.President Richard Nixon proposed the establishment of EPA on July 9, 1970; it began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an executive order.The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate. The agency is led by its administrator, who is appointed by the president and approved by the Senate.The current administrator is Michael S. Regan. The EPA is not a Cabinet department, but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Richard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) was the 37th president of the United States, serving from 1969 to 1974. A member of the Republican Party, Nixon previously served as the 36th vice president from 1953 to 1961, having risen to national prominence as a representative and senator from California. After five years in the White House that saw the conclusion to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, détente with the Soviet Union and China, the first manned moon landings, and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency, he became the only president to resign from the office, following the Watergate scandal.</li>

        <li>Industrial pollution:
            <ul>
                <li>Pollutants from industrial complexes can include carbon monoxide, ozone, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). These harmful substances can be absorbed by your skin as well as your respiratory system.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Volatile organic compounds (VOC) are organic chemicals that have a high vapour pressure at room temperature. High vapor pressure correlates with a low boiling point, which relates to the number of the sample's molecules in the surrounding air, a trait known as volatility.</li>
                        <li>Health risks:
                            <ul>Respiratory, allergic, or immune effects in infants or children are associated with man-made VOCs and other indoor or outdoor air pollutants.Some VOCs, such as styrene and limonene, can react with nitrogen oxides or with ozone to produce new oxidation products and secondary aerosols, which can cause sensory irritation symptoms.VOCs contribute to the formation of Tropospheric ozone and smog.Health effects include eye, nose, and throat irritation; headaches, loss of coordination, nausea; and damage to the liver, kidney, and central nervous system.Some organics can cause cancer in animals; some are suspected or known to cause cancer in humans. Key signs or symptoms associated with exposure to VOCs include conjunctival irritation, nose and throat discomfort, headache, allergic skin reaction, dyspnea, declines in serum cholinesterase levels, nausea, vomiting, nose bleeding, fatigue, dizziness.</ul>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Combustion:
            <ul>
                <li>Combustion, whether from coal burning, wildfires, outdoor barbecues or indoor fires, produces a host of airborne pollutants, including carbon monoxide, gaseous chemicals and particulate matter, according to the EPA.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Airborne pollutants are particulates, biological molecules or other harmful materials that exist in the atmosphere. These pollutants are known to cause harm to health and the environment. Examples include persistent organic pollutants (POPs), carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides.
                            <ul>Carbon monoxide (chemical formula CO) is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, flammable gas that is slightly less dense than air. Carbon monoxide consists of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom. It is the simplest molecule of the oxocarbon family. In coordination complexes the carbon monoxide ligand is called carbonyl. It is a key ingredient in many processes in industrial chemistry.Thermal combustion is the most common source of carbon monoxide, however there are numerous environmental and biological sources that generate and emit a significant amount of carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is an important in the production of many compounds ranging from drugs, fragrances, and fuels. It is produced by many organisms, including humans.Upon emission into the atmosphere, carbon monoxide may have roles potentially affecting climate change.</ul>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Weather:
            <ul>
                <li>The weather can also have a significant impact on the concentration of pollutants in the air. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), sunshine can react with compounds in the air to form smog, and higher air temperatures can speed up these reactions. Additionally, a phenomenon called “temperature inversion” can trap surface air near the ground and keep it from rising. When the air becomes stagnant during an inversion, pollutant concentrations can build up to dangerous levels.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The National Weather Service (NWS) is an agency of the United States federal government that is tasked with providing weather forecasts, warnings of hazardous weather, and other weather-related products to organizations and the public for the purposes of protection, safety, and general information. It is a part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) branch of the Department of Commerce, and is headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland, within the Washington metropolitan area.</li>
                        <li>Temperature inversion, also called thermal inversion, a reversal of the normal behaviour of temperature in the troposphere (the region of the atmosphere nearest Earth’s surface), in which a layer of cool air at the surface is overlain by a layer of warmer air. (Under normal conditions air temperature usually decreases with height.)</li>
